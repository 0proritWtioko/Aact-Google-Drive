Vinewood Souvenirs The Last Act is the final Strangers & Freaks Mission for the UK tourists in IGN's Grand Theft Auto 5 Walkthrough. This guide will highlight the main mission strategies and Gold Medal requirements needed to complete every main story mission. Check out more of IGN's GTA5 Walkthrough for info on Cheats, Easter Eggs, Strangers and Freaks and a lot more.
 
When the mission begins, get into Nigel's car and drive it to the waypoint at the train tracks. Midway thru the drive, Al offers you $3,000 to let him go: keep on driving and he'll offer you $10,000 to release him from the trunk. For the Gold requirement, avoid stopping the car and continue towards the train tracks.
 
As soon as you get on the train tracks, slam on the gas and drive towards the train at full speed. Jump out of the car just before you hit the train to get the Gold. Be sure to jump out two seconds before the train hits otherwise, Trevor won't have enough time to even open the door to jump out.
 
The AACT tool brings people together to get a deeper understanding and agreement on where the group is in its work together. The AACT is not designed to compare or rank communities. It is intended to help communities determine where attention can be focused to accelerate community transformation.
 
**What:**The AACT tool allows communities to directly collect and use data about their collaborative efforts. It provides a platform for learning with and from communities about their challenges and trajectories. This shared process allows communities to reflect, prioritize, and align actions.
 
Unlike other assessments, the AACT is a validated tool that is collaborative-driven, collaborative-directed, and accessible to all for free. It was developed based on learnings from both the literature and decades of real-world, community experience.
 
**How**: The AACT tool provides each participant with an individual report of their responses. For the group of participants, a Combined Scores Report is generated, with variation for each indicator noted.
 
The following images are available for you to use to promote the AACT Tool. Please download and use for your preferred social media platform. If you would like any of these graphics customized, please contact [email protected].
 
The AACT tool was designed to help individuals and teams understand how far along the group is in its journey toward health transformation and what areas can be strengthened to help go further. The tool includes
 
Compost Tea is a liquid concentrate containing all the beneficial microbial components that compost is famous for. These living beneficial microbes are the biology that drives the **soil food web**in a healthy functioning soil. The soil food web is responsible for:
 
Inorganic (chemical) fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and mechanical compaction damage these beneficial soil microbes and reduce or delete the benefits of a healthy soil food web. This breakdown of microbial functioning can be the cause of poor plant growth and color, low resistance to garden pests and pathogens and decreased fruit and vegetable production. Without the re-introduction of the beneficial microbes found in well-made compost, garden maintenance becomes a dependent cycle of chemical inputs and controls, spreading pesticide pollution by air and leaching through the soil to pollute our ground water, creeks and bay waters.
 
AACT can be used full strength or diluted up to 1:4. If chloramine-treated city water is used for dilution the water must be pre-treated using Amquel or another aquarium product that breaks down the chloramine. Another treatment to neutralize the chloramine is by mixing a small amount of liquid humates into the city water before putting the AACT in. Application can be made manually with a watering can to the soil. Rinse out the container and let it air dry.
 
Tea brewing & compost production are under the direction of Alane Weber, Certified Advisor for the Soil Foodweb, Inc (www.soilfoodweb.com) and are regularly tested for microbial health and diversity. Test results are available upon request.
